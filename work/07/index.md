# Project Deliverable 3

The project is in full swing now. Kudos to everyone for getting started early! I hope everyone has fun and gains a lot of valuable experience. The TAs and I are here to help you achieve both of these goals.

In class we talked about how an Agile team works on a software development project: the process, the roles, etc., in great detail. The project is where you put all this knowledge in practice. This document outlines how your work will be assessed.

## Product Backlog

By the time of the submission, you should have gone through one sprint at least or more. This means that you have started to work on your user stories. 

After a sprint, you might have decided to change either the personas or the user stories before going to the next sprint. Therefore, you should provide a new version of these personas and/or user-stories (and so the version number of these documents should evolved). In addition, you should provide an explanation about what has changed between the two versions. 

Going through your first sprint means that you have decomposed the first user stories into tasks. Therefore, your product backlog should contains a list of tasks associated with user stories. Each task should have a brief description, story points and dependencies if any. In addition, each task should come with a detailed description that contains all kind of useful information that will be used by the developer while working on this task. This detailed description is the result of the team brainstorming on what the result of this task should be. It could include technological choices, third-party tools and APIs, documentation, UI design sketch, UML specification or any description of the code structure, pseudo-code, testing strategies and so on and so forth.

## Sprint Backlog

Each sprint should have its own sprint backlog. For this deliverable, each sprint backlog should contain: 

- **sprint plan:** the detailed task allocation plan of who will do what and when during that sprint. 

- **provisional burndown chart:** that shows how the story points will be burned throughout the sprint if everything goes according to the sprint plan. 

## Presentation and Quality of Writing

Similarly to previous deliverables, feel free to choose how to organize and present your deliverable. Make sure that it looks professional and is very easy to read. The TAs will not have much time and you need to convince them you did an excellent job! The following will always be considered when grading your work in this course:

- Presentation: the deliverable is well organized, formatted, looks professional, is easy to read and to navigate. 
- Quality of writing: language, grammar, clarity, professionalism.

## Submission

Submit your **product backlog** and your **sprint Backlog(s)** by pushing them into your team’s GitHub repository by the due date and time. In addition, the source code of your product should also be on your team’s GitHub repository. Make sure to include instructions about how to build and execute your product. The TA might will likely take a look at your code and execute it to make sure it matches your product and sprint backlogs. 

Additionally, update your team’s GitHub repository README file to reflect the progress on your project. 

## Coming next

There is no deliverable for this part. 

As a team, you should start tracking your progress in each sprint. After a sprint, you should reflect on your progress and take then into considerations when planning for the next sprint.
